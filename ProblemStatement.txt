(#) 'ONLINE STORE APPLICATION' (#)

# Project Goal:
    Create an online store application that allows users to browse products, add to cart, checkout and manage orders.

# Required Concepts
    Classes
        -> Product: Represents a product with attributes like name, price, quantity and description.
        -> Cart: Represents a shopping cart with methods to add, remove and view products.
        -> Order: Represents an order with attributes like orderID, customer information and products.
    
    Data Structures
        Use arrays or files to store products in the catalog and cart
    
    Inheritance
        Create derived class for different product types (Eg. Book, Electronics) to add specific attributes or methods

    Polymorphism
        Use Polymorphism to handle different payment methods (Eg. CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment) through a base Payment Class.

    Exception Handling
        Implement Exception handling to catch errors like invalid input, out-of-stock products, or payment processing failures.

# Rubrics
    => Functionality: The application should allow users to browse products, add to cart, checkout, and view order history

    => Data Structures: Use arrays / files to store products and orders

    => Object-Oriented Design: Use classes and objects to model the application's entries

    => Inheritance and Polymorphism: Implement Inheritance and Polymorphism for product types and payment methods

    => Error Handling: Handle potential errors gracefully using exceptions

    => User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application

    => Efficiency: Optimize the application for performance, especially when dealing with large product catalogs and many orders.
